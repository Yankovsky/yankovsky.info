<div>Finally I decided to create personal website: to be more social and to fight procrastination. At first I thought about some blog engine or cms.</div>
<div>But I hate all these shitty themes, deploying, trying to understand why I have whole bunch of useless files.</div>
<div>And if you want something special, you should dig in php code. Oh, man...</div>
<div>These aren't things that I want to learn, knowledge which I will be proud of.</div>
<div>Then I suddenly realized that I don't need any kind of backend and db. I just need to serve static webpages.</div>
<div>And I know one free, developer-friendly, convenient service, that can easily handle my current and future requests.</div>
<div>It is Heroku! Actually it requires some server running, but it was quite a fun to write simple one on nodejs.</div>
<div>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/Yankovsky/static-heroku-nodejs">detailed instruction how to publish static website on Heroku</a>.</div>
<div>Time to reinvent bicycle! I've already added partials by separating header and footer html blocks and my genius server can distinguish css and html!</div>
<div>Isn't it awesome?!</div>
