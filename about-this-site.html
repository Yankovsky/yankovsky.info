<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>Finally I decided to create personal website: to be more social and to fight procrastination.</p>
<p>
    At first I thought about some blog engine or cms.
    But I hate all these shitty themes, deploying, trying to understand why I have whole bunch of useless files.
    And if you want something special, you should dig in php code. Oh, man...
    These aren't things that I want to learn, knowledge which I will be proud of.
</p>

    Then I suddenly realized that I don't need any kind of backend and db. I just need to serve static webpages.
    And I know one free, developer-friendly, convenient service, that can easily handle my current and future requests.
    It is Heroku! Actually it requires some server running, but it was quite a fun to write simple one on nodejs.
    Here is a <a href="https://github.com/Yankovsky/static-heroku-nodejs">detailed instruction how to publish static website on Heroku</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Time to reinvent bicycle! I've already added partials by separating header and footer html blocks and my genius server can distinguish css and html!
    Isn't it awesome?!
</p>

    <b>UPDATE</b>: Heroku dyno go idle if no one visit your page for hour. So you need to ping it from time to time.
    There are tons of options available, but I used <a href="http://beouk.blogspot.ru/2012/02/keeping-heroku-awake.html">Heroku scheduler approach</a>
    and <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler#defining-tasks">documentation on defining scheduler task</a>.
    I ended up with single file bin/ping_website:
</p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'net/http'
puts "request home page to awake dyno"
Net::HTTP.get(URI('http://www.yankovsky.info/'))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
    After pushing it to Heroku you need to configure scheduler addon.
