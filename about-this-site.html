<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>
    Finally I decided to create personal website: to be more social and to fight procrastination.
</p>
<p>
    I try to keep up with <a href='diary.html'>my diary</a> and <a href='/'>challenge myself from time to time</a>.
    This website was build from scratch with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle'>KISS</a> principle in mind and
    it is <a href='website-evolution.html'>constantly evolving</a>.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this website is my personal playground. Enjoy!</p>
