<h1>Working on neoclassic.pro website</h1>
<p>
    My brother Dmitry Yankovskiy is opera/musical singer, who decided to start his own project Neoclassic some time ago.
    The main idea is to make classical music covers with modern sound and vice versa.
    For example watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WxP-SeQ7M">System Of A Down - Toxicity cover</a>.
</p>
<p>
    So he want a website and guess who he asked to make one? Yep. So here we are.
    It should be simple business card website with some interesting features, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>images && news slider.</li>
    <li>radio (real radio with rotation and live, not just tracks list).</li>
    <li>ability to write some post only once and publish it to all these social networks and twitters.</li>
    <li>responsive design</li>
</ul>
<p>
    And as I'm not paid and my client is my brother, I can go wild about technologies and use whatever I want.
</p>
<p>
    Firstly, I do hate cms, because when I face one, I always do research and find that something just made wrong under the hood.
    Of course they have their use, and maybe requirements of this website is perfect match for cms, but I just don't like them.
    Anything you want to do out of cms scope can become a real pain.
    So it will be <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> on backend and custom admin pages.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, I decided, that it will be single page application - this way I can save radio player state between pages without using iframe or separate window,
    learn <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html">history api</a>, reduce bandwidth. After all, let's admit it, single page apps are trendy and hipsterious.
    On the client I want to play with <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> framework.
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, I want to learn how to automate js && css build process,
    try <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a> || <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> || <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">stylus</a>
    and play with <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I don't care about db. I will try to limit use of frontend libs to <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscorejs</a>.
    As I want to publish news on all social networks I will need to learn how <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> works.
    Currently I have <a href="http://grooving.me:8017/stream">neoclassic radio endpoint</a> provided by <a href="http://www.centova.com/">Centova</a>,
    but I don't understand how it works and how to make live broadcast.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of these tasks have bullets in my <a href="developer-challenge.html">developer daily challenge list</a>.
