<h1>Weekly games challenge</h1>
<p>
    As a 20 years experienced gamer and a bit less experienced programmer I just need to try myself as a game developer.
    I know nothing in this field, so I decided to start with simple stuff and wrap it up in a challenge again,
    because it is the best way to motivate yourself.
