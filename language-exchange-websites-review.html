            Website is from 90s - chat, forums, flash. You need to pay for registration.
            Nothing special about content. Move on

            Interesting one. You correct others' writing, they correct your's. Both win.
            Quite active community. Not the best design I've ever saw, but it works and that's what's important.
            Dunno what "L points" mean, but this kind of gamification works for sure.
            I received my first correction in 1 minute. Helping other people, you improve your own skill.
            Definitely, I will return to this website.

            I didn't receive activation email, so I couldn't sign up, but I guess, that I didn't miss anything.
            Website is just a small database of people willing to learn something. No services at all.

            At my first visit of this website I was lucky to instantly participate in "Word explainer" game.
            It was pretty fun, but our team lost terribly.
            It was unfair as I'm Russian and my partner was from Libya, I guess, but we were faced with two Brits.
            Now there are no people on website willing to play a game, so I can't get my revenge.
            And there is nothing interesting except this game.
