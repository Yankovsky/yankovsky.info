    2 years exp of remote work.
    I work remotely, but I am ready to move to some country.

    Personally, I like to think about myself as a backend developer on frontend. I learned to love js for its simplicity
    I love to write application logic, custom components,
    Currently I prefer JS, but I am OK with other programming languages.
